# Automated-Relay-Switch

 _An arduino-controlled normally-open relay for automatically switching AC voltage supply on and off at user-defined time intervals and durations. Included are the build notes. Part of the Open Science Framework repository [Open2DM](https://osf.io/evupy/)_

### Background \& Motivation

_This is part of the [Open2DM](https://osf.io/evupy/) labware project._

For our group's research on synthesing two-dimensional materials (e.g., Graphene, MoS2, h-BN, etc.), we required a shear mixing process to operate at  discrete on-off time intervals. We also required our tests to stop at   

This repository provides the build details and code for creating a relay that can automatically switch between the default Normally-Open (NO) state to a closed circuit, supplying the AC from the wall socket (240V). The  at a predifined time interval.  

### Disclaimer!

Working with AC can be dangerous. Make sure to take all precautions when making modifications and ensure everything is unplugged and grounded.

## Potential Changes

List of changes and whether they have been implemented.

- [ ] The wiring into and out of the DIN enclosure could be tidied up using suitable bulkhead fittings or rubber grommets.
